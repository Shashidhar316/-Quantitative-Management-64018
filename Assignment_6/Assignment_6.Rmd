# Formulate and solving the problem :

```{r}
# Loading required package
library(lpSolveAPI)
getwd()

# Reading the lp file
IP <- read.lp("shashi.lp")
#Displaying the file

# What was the total cost?
```{r}
# Refer to the Objective Function solution.
get.objective(IP)
# In order to meet the required number of workers working every day, the weekly total salary must be $25,765. In other words, the total weekly wage cost is $25,675.

```

```{r}
# Determine the best number of variables.
get.variables(IP)


# Total: $25,675.
```
# How many workers are available each day?
```{r}
# Look at the restrictions.
